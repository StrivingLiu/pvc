Python reimplementation of vmware-cmd tool.

This tool, written in Python, attempts to duplicate as much
functionality as possible from the classic Perl-based vmware-cmd tool,
and it adds a few tricks of its own, like more flexible and intuitive
command-line parsing, configurable output formats, and an interactive
shell mode (-i).

This tool currently relies on pyVim (and pyVmomi).
